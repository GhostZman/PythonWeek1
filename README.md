# Introduction

This series is built to teach Python as a first text-based programming language. Prior knowledge of block-based coding may be helpful, but is not essential. Each week will introduces key programming concepts and how they are used in Python.

This week, you will get set up to begin coding, and learn the basics of how to make a program interact with it's user.

# Setting Up Github and Codespaces

Before you can start programming, you need a place to store your code. While you could just store it on whatever computer you are using, that requires more setup and limits you to programming only on that device. Instead you will be using **[GitHub](https://github.com)** to store repositories of your code so it can be accessed anywhere. You will also be using GitHub's web based code editor **Codespaces**.

Alternatively, instead of codespaces you can do your code editing on your own computer with more setup so you can edit your code without an internet connection and upload it to github when you are connected. If you would like to do this, instructions are in [Local-Code-Setup](local_code_setup.md).

Here's what you should do:

1. Create a **[GitHub](https://github.com)** Account
    - Click on the link above.
    - Click the sign up button.
    - Enter your email address and create a password and username. **Make sure your Username is appropriate.** (You can use a personal or school email address as long as you can log into it, you can always add or remove email address to or from your account in the future) 
    - Verify your account by following any other steps GitHub asks you to do.
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/GhostZman/PythonWeek1) to your GitHub account
    - Click on the link above.
    - Click the Fork button at the top right of the page.
    - Click the Create fork button.
3. Open the repsoitory in **GitHub Codespaces**
    - Click the green Code button.
    - Click the Create codespace on main button.

# How to Use Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are a tool to develop and document code. Any file with the file extention **.ipynb** is a jupyter notebook.

Jupyter notebooks consist of boxes called cells. Each cell is either a code cell, which can run whatever code is in it, or a markdown cell, which contains text. Code cells can be run by pressing the "play" button to the left of the cell, or by selecting the cell and pressing **Shift + Enter**. When run, a cell will run its code and will show its progess in its lower left corner. When it's done, it will either displace a checkmark or X to show if it succeeded or had an error, and display how long it took to run.

Cells will run individually, so each cell will need to be run, however code in a cell that has already been run will affect future code.

# Week 1 Instructions

1. Open the [Week_1_Examples.ipynb](Week_1_Examples.ipynb) notebook.
    - Look to the left side of codespaces to see the file explorer, which shows all the files in this repository.
2. Follow the instructions inside the notebook:
    - Learn to use the `print()` function.
    - Experiment with variables.
    - Try the `input()` function to get user input.
3. Use the blank cells at the bottom of the notebook to experiment and write your own code.
4. Open the [Week_1_Activities.ipynb](Week_1_Activities.ipynb) notebook.
5. Try the activites to practice your new coding skills.
